# Udemy Python for Data Analysis Stock Market Jupyter notebook

This notebook contains the code used to follow the Stock Market project in the Python for Data Analysis and Visualization course offered by Udemy (lectures 61 through 65 as of 2016-03-24).

The time scale for the random walk was set to be 250 iterations of 1 day, and the expected return and risk used were also those for 1 day - the $$\Delta$$t was therefore 1.
